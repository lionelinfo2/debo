The combination of Service Oriented Architectures and Business Processes creates an enactment environment where processes can be deployed and executed automatically. From a managerial and technical point of view, the interpretation, control and execution of a process flow happens very often at one point in the organizational and IT structure. This creates an inflexible environment, where control over and visibility of cross-departmental processes cannot be distributed across these organizational entities. Moreover, a centralized approach creates a performance bottleneck and a single point of failure in process execution. As the number of process instantiation requests increases, time to successfully handle one process instance increases. In this project we look at a non-intrusive, automatic approach to distribute the process flow over different organizational entities, hereby also increasing performance and removing any single point of failure. Special attention is given to flexibility: each distributed process part becomes autonomous, hereby creating the ability to easily add new process fragments, change the deployment structure and add monitoring and management tools without any additional effort.
